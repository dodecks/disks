dodecks are 12 sided disks

There are various sizes, each of these directories has STL 
and JPG files for disks of that diameter.

Disks are named for their diameter and attachment patterns.
2010 is 20mm x 10mm, also 2020 and 4040 

The 106mm and 127mm sizes are for smaller 3D printers.
My old FlashForge Finder was 5 x 5 x 5 inch. 127mm max.
