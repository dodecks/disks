this is the open hardware project 
dodeck.net - a platform for making robots

dodeck = dodec(agon) + (dec)k

dodecks are 12 sided disks, with uniform edges and open 1cm grids

These disks are stacked to make turtle style dual-differential robots, 
like those used by universities with ROS2. Many others are possible.

There are various sizes, each of these directories has STL and JPG. 
Disks are named for their diameter and the size of patterns that hold 
servo drive motor adapters. 2010 is 20mm x 10mm, also 2020 and 4040.

The 106mm and 127mm sizes are for smaller 3D printers.
My old FlashForge Finder was 5 x 5 x 5 inch. 127mm max.

  these were cut on a CNC machine, too big for 3D print
  The 40mm x 20mm cutouts are for servos to turn wheels.
